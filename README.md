This repository is for the completion of Programming Assignment 3 that invloved concepts and methods in Chapter 5 like Euler Method and Runge-Kutta Method. To run the code you need import numpy as np which is in the requirements.txt and I used a requirements.txt. I used python for this assignment for the code because we were told to use python and to run the code you really just need to copy the code and run it on the complier you are using. Some commands to run the code are import numpy as np, def euler_method(func, t0, y0, t_end, num_iterations):, def func(t, y):, print(expected_output), def runge_kutta_method(func, t0, y0, t_end, num_iterations):, def func(t, y):, print( expected_output).

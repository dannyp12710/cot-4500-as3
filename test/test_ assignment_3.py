# For Question 1 you will use the Euler Method with the following 

# a. Function: t – y 2
# b. Range: 0 < t < 2
# c. Iterations: 10
# d. Initial Point: f(0) = 1


# For Question 2 you will use the Runge-Kutta Method with the following 

# a. Function: t – y 2
# b. Range: 0 < t < 2
# c. Iterations: 10
# d. Initial Point: f(0) = 1
